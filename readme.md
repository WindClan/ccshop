# ccshop

### this is a fork of [yfshop](https://github.com/yourfriendoss/yfshop) intended to have more features. it is NOT compatible with the original.
this shop is intended for POWERUSERS.  
do NOT except a simple to use interface.
1. Run the installer script: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windclan/ccshop/main/installer.lua` then `installer.lua`
2. copy `fwshop/settings-example.lua` to `fwshop/settings.lua`
3. edit `fwshop/settings.lua` (I reccomend using )
4. start fwshop by `cd ccshop` `ccshop`.  
4.1. you can setup a startup script by copying the startup.lua file to your PC.
